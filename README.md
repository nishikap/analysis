# Data Analysis- Using SQL 
Utilized Excel to analyze data and uncover patterns and trends. Leveraging pivot charts, I created an interactive chart to visualize the insights. Additionally, I employed data-cleaning techniques to transform raw data into valuable information and then developed an interactive chart to explore market demand based on average income, commute distance, and age.
